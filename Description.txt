This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface and JDBC for database connectivity. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3Ã—3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game randomly selects the first player, manages user interactions through buttons, and checks for winning conditions. When a player wins, the winning line is highlighted, and a "Play Again" button appears for restarting the game. Additionally, the program keeps track of the number of wins for both "X" and "O" and updates this data in a MySQL database. The database stores cumulative win counts, ensuring that statistics persist across sessions. This project demonstrates key concepts of GUI development, event handling, and database interaction in Java.
